		<h2>Dope Hip Hop</h2>
		<p>
			A few years ago I discovered something called "rap jazz" and it changed my life. This site is dedicated to hip hop
			groups that I feel epitomize rap jazz and alt hip hop. There are dozens of other groups, but these one are my
			personal favorites. The information about each artist was taken from <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a> and
			<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This site was built using CSS Grid and p5.js, and hip hop.
